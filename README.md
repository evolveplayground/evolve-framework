## Key Features

- 🤖 **Customizable Agents**: Define agents with tailored characteristics and behaviors
- 🔄 **Interactive Social Systems**: Simulate dynamic interactions and relationships
- 💾 **Persistent Data Models**: Store and leverage agents' memories for enhanced realism
- 🌐 **Multi-Environment Support**: Manage interconnected simulation spaces
- 💱 **Economic Modules**: Integrate virtual marketplaces and currency systems
- 🔌 **Flexible Integrations**: Support for multiple language models and APIs
- 🌍 **Real-Time Data Access**: Enable agent interaction with live external data

## Usage Instructions

### Adding Citizens

Generate and manage agents in your simulation:

```bash
# Add new agents
npm run addCitizens
```

### Simulate Interactions

Create and monitor interactions:

```bash
# Generate dynamic interactions
npm run addInteractions

# Interact with an agent
npm run chat "AgentFirstName" "AgentLastName"
```

### Advanced Options

Simulate specific scenarios:

```bash
npm run specificInteraction
```
