// Evolve Framework City Network Management

// This module defines the CityNetwork class for managing inter-city connections and events in the Evolve Framework.

// CityNetwork manages the connections and interactions between multiple cities
export class CityNetwork {
  private cities: Map<string, City>; // Stores city data by city ID
  private connections: Map<string, Set<string>>; // Manages connections between cities
