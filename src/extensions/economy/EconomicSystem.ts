// Evolve Framework Economic System Module

// This module manages economic interactions, currencies, and markets within the Evolve Framework.
// It defines core structures and methods for handling transactions, markets, and exchange rates.

  private exchangeRates: Map<string, Map<string, number>>; // Exchange rates between currencies
