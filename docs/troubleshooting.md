# Troubleshooting Guide

## Core Features (Stable)

### Installation Issues

#### npm Install Fails
```bash
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory
```
**Solution**:
1. Confirm that you are in the correct directory.
2. Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
3. Retry by running `npm install`.

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
Error: Missing API key
```
**Solution**:
1. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Insert your OpenAI API key into the appropriate field.
3. Ensure the key is valid and has sufficient credits.

### Simulation Issues

#### City Initialization Fails
```bash
Error: Failed to initialize city
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify connectivity to the OpenAI API.
2. Confirm write permissions in the `data` directory.
3. Check that all configuration files contain valid JSON.

#### Character Generation Problems
```bash
Error: Unable to create character
```
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `characters.json` is present and formatted correctly.
2. Verify there is enough disk space.
3. Check for concurrent modifications that may cause conflicts.

#### Interaction Generation Fails
```bash
Error: Cannot generate interactions
```
**Solution**:
1. Confirm at least two citizens are available.
2. Check for corruption in relationship data.
3. Ensure the memory system is functioning properly.

### Chat System Issues

#### Chat Command Not Responding
```bash
Error: Chat session failed to initialize
```
**Solution**:
1. Verify the citizen exists in the database.
2. Confirm the name format is correct.
3. Ensure there are no active chat sessions blocking the initialization.

#### Memory Corruption
```bash
Error: Invalid memory state
```
**Solution**:
1. Create a backup of the `data` directory.
2. Run the integrity check script.
3. Restore data from the most recent stable backup.

## Experimental Features

> **Note**: The following sections pertain to troubleshooting experimental features. These features are in development and may be unstable.

### Multi-City System

#### Connection Issues
```bash
Error: Failed to connect cities
```
**Temporary Solution**:
1. Validate that city IDs are correct and exist.
2. Confirm network configuration is accurate.
3. Restart the city network service.

### Economic System

#### Transaction Failures
```bash
Error: Transaction failed to process
```
**Temporary Solution**:
1. Confirm the validity of the currency involved.
2. Check the market state for inconsistencies.
3. Verify sufficient funds are available.

### Internet Connectivity

#### Web Access Issues
```bash
Error: Failed to fetch web content
```
**Temporary Solution**:
1. Ensure the internet connection is active.
2. Check for API rate limits.
3. Validate that the URL format is correct.

### Cultural Events

#### Event Creation Problems
```bash
Error: Cannot create cultural event
```
**Temporary Solution**:
1. Validate the event parameters.
2. Confirm that the location is available.
3. Ensure there are sufficient resources to support the event.

### Education System

#### Learning Process Failures
```bash
Error: Cannot initiate learning process
```
**Temporary Solution**:
1. Verify prerequisite skills are met.
2. Check the capacity of the institution.
3. Confirm course enrollment details are accurate.

## Common Error Messages

### Core System
```typescript
SimulationError: "Invalid state transition"
- Validate the system state.
- Confirm the operation sequence is correct.
- Review logs for recent state changes.
```

### Data Management
```typescript
DataError: "Corrupted data structure"
- Backup the current data.
- Run data validation scripts.
- Restore from the most recent backup if necessary.
```

### API Integration
```typescript
APIError: "Rate limit exceeded"
- Implement request throttling mechanisms.
- Verify API quotas and usage.
- Utilize caching to reduce redundant requests.
```

## Performance Optimization

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - Limit the number of citizens.
   - Prune outdated memory records.
   - Cache frequent operations to reduce overhead.

2. **API Efficiency**:
   - Batch requests where possible.
   - Use rate-limiting strategies.
   - Implement local caching for repetitive API calls.

3. **Data Management**:
   - Schedule regular backups.
   - Perform periodic data cleanup.
   - Optimize database indexing for faster queries.
