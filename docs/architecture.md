# Evolve's Architecture

# This document provides an overview of Evolve's system architecture, describing the interplay of its modular components to create a dynamic and scalable virtual city simulation platform.

## System Overview

Evolve is designed with a modular architecture comprising the following key components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Evolve Platform            │
├─────────────┬───────────┬───────────────┤
│  Simulation │ API Layer │ Event Handler │
├─────────────┼───────────┼───────────────┤
│ Extensions  │ Database  │ Auth System   │
└─────────────┴───────────┴───────────────┘
```

## Core Components

### 1. Simulation Module
- Manages primary simulation logic.
- Oversees resources and infrastructure in the virtual city.
- Simulates citizen interactions and behavior.
- Controls time progression and schedules events.

### 2. API Layer
- Provides RESTful API endpoints for integration.
- Supports WebSocket for real-time communication.
- Includes middleware for authentication and authorization.
- Implements rate limiting and ensures API security.

### 3. Event Handler
- Implements a publish/subscribe mechanism for events.
- Processes real-time events efficiently.
- Logs and monitors event activity.
- Supports custom event handlers for extensions.

### 4. Database Layer
- Handles persistent storage for city data.
- Integrates a caching mechanism for frequent data retrieval.
- Supports data migrations and backups.
- Optimizes queries for performance.

### 5. Extension Module
- Enables plug-and-play functionality for new features.
- Standardized APIs for seamless integration.
- Ensures resource isolation.
- Manages version compatibility effectively.

## Data Flow

1. **Input Reception**
   - User interactions.
   - Triggered system events.
   - Activations from extensions.

2. **Core Processing**
   - Validates incoming events.
   - Updates the system state.
   - Executes core business logic.

3. **Output Delivery**
   - Formats responses.
   - Dispatches notifications.
   - Synchronizes updated states.

## Security Architecture

- JWT (JSON Web Token) based user authentication.
- Enforces role-based access control.
- Manages API keys securely.
- Includes rate limiting to prevent misuse.
- Validates inputs to block potential threats.
- Protects against SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

## Scalability

Designed for seamless scaling:

- Uses a microservices architecture.
- Balances load dynamically.
- Employs database sharding techniques.
- Includes caching to reduce database stress.
- Asynchronous task execution for efficiency.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging for traceability.
- Performance monitoring metrics.
- Tracks errors for prompt resolution.
- Monitors resource utilization in real time.
- Logs user activities for audits.

## Deployment Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Load      │────│   API       │
│   Balancer  │    │   Gateway   │
└─────────────┘    └──────┬──────┘
                          │
     ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
     │                   │                   │
┌────┴─────┐      ┌─────┴─────┐      ┌──────┴────┐
│  Service  │      │  Service  │      │  Service  │
│  Node 1   │      │  Node 2   │      │  Node 3   │
└──────────┘      └───────────┘      └───────────┘
```

## Future Considerations

- Incorporate Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Explore serverless architecture.
- Enable edge computing for distributed systems.
- Integrate AI/ML pipelines for intelligent decisions.
- Investigate blockchain use cases.

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js version 14 or higher for backend services.
- PostgreSQL 12+ as the database solution.
- Redis for implementing caching layers.
- Docker for containerized environments.
- Nginx for reverse proxy management.
